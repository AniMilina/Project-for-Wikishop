# Project-for-Wikishop  

The Wikishop online store is launching a new service. Now users can edit and add product descriptions, just like in wiki communities. That is, clients propose their own edits and comment on the changes of others. The store needs a tool that will   look for toxic comments and send them for moderation.  

Train the model to classify comments into positive and negative. At your disposal is a set of data with markings about the toxicity of edits.  

Build a model with an F1 quality metric value of at least 0.75.  

Instructions for completing the project  

Download and prepare data.  
Train different models.

You don't have to use BERT to complete your project, but you can try it.  

Data Description  

The data is in the toxic_comments.csv file. The text column in it contains the text of the comment, and toxic is the target attribute.
